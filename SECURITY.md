## Security Best Practices

### Angular Project

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your Angular dependencies to the latest versions to ensure you have the latest security patches.
2. **Use Angular's Built-in Security Features**: Utilize Angular's built-in security features such as sanitization, content security policy (CSP), and Angular's HttpClient for making HTTP requests.
3. **Avoid Using `innerHTML`**: Avoid using `innerHTML` to insert dynamic content. Use Angular's data binding instead.
4. **Enable Strict Template Checking**: Enable strict template checking in your `tsconfig.json` to catch potential security issues early.
5. **Use Angular CLI**: Use Angular CLI to generate components, services, and other code to ensure best practices are followed.

### Python Scripts

1. **Validate Input**: Always validate and sanitize input data to prevent injection attacks.
2. **Use Secure Libraries**: Use well-maintained and secure libraries for making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.
3. **Handle Exceptions**: Properly handle exceptions to avoid exposing sensitive information.
4. **Limit Permissions**: Run your Python scripts with the least privileges necessary to reduce the impact of a potential security breach.
5. **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update your Python dependencies to the latest versions to ensure you have the latest security patches.
